How to Reorder Markets:

1. Navigate to the Markets section:
   * Access via the left sidebar menu
   * Select the specific sport (e.g., Football)
   * You'll see the "Manage Football markets" screen
2. Understanding the interface:
   * Each market has a numbered box (#0, #1, #2, etc.) indicating its current position. You can click on this number to change it manually.
   * Markets are displayed with their full names (e.g., "Win To Nil (2nd Half)")
   * Each market has toggle switches for "Exchange Active" and "Bookie Active"
3. Reordering process:
   * Simply click and drag any market row to your desired position
   * The numbers will automatically update to reflect the new order
   * Markets will be displayed on the frontend in this exact sequence
   * Click "Save Markets Order" in the top right to confirm changes
4. Important considerations:
   * Disabled markets (toggles off) won't appear on the frontend regardless of order
   * The order affects all frontend displays of these markets
   * Changes take effect immediately after saving
   * You can use the search function to quickly find specific markets
