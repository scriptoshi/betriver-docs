**Odds Spread Profit Example**

Let's say a user wants to place the following bets:

* Odds of 1.45 for $6
* Odds of 1.55 for $10
* Odds of 1.66 for $30
* Odds of 1.86 for $20

With an Odds Spread setting of 0.2, the platform will group these bets into a range of 0.2. So instead of using the exact odds, the platform will present the "worst" (highest) odds within that 0.2 range.

In this case, the range would be:

* 1.45 to 1.65

The platform would then use the highest odds of 1.65 to calculate the payouts, instead of the actual odds provided by the user.

This allows the platform admin to make a profit, as the payouts will be slightly lower than what the user expects based on the original odds they provided.

For example, with the 1.65 odds:

* $6 bet at 1.65 pays out $9.90 instead of $8.70 (at 1.45 odds)
* $10 bet at 1.65 pays out $16.50 instead of $15.50 (at 1.55 odds)
* $30 bet at 1.65 pays out $49.50 instead of $49.80 (at 1.66 odds)
* $20 bet at 1.65 pays out $33.00 instead of $37.20 (at 1.86 odds)

The small differences in payouts add up to create profit for the platform admin, while still maintaining a competitive edge over traditional bookmakers.
